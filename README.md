## Projects

### 2023 Top 100 NBA Players Visualizations
Chosen Datasets & Sources
1. Main Data Set: Top 100 NBA Players Projections & Current Performance Statistics for 2023 - 2024: <a href="https://hashtagbasketball.com/fantasy-basketball-rankings"> Hashtag Basketball</a>
2. 2022-2023 NBA Player Demographics: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data"> Kaggle</a>


#### Objective:
This project aims to conduct a detailed analysis of the top 100 NBA players’ performance,
focusing specifically on the correlation between player demographics (e.g. age and height)
and the nine standard statistical categories for the 2023-2024 season (using pre-season
projected and current performance measures). This analysis is not only pertinent to sports
enthusiasts and analysts but also holds significant value in the domains of both sports
management and betting industries. Understanding the impact of demographics on
performance can aid in player development, team composition internally, betting strategies
for industry outsiders and plenty of other real life applicable relevant uses.

#### Preliminary Analysis
#### Hypothesis: 
Age correlates with certain improvements or declines in specific statistical performance categories. For instance, older players might show a pattern of underperforming in some projected performance categories for the season. However we also hypothesize that the negative impact of old age is overestimated in projections as modern
medicine and longevity-focused practices have improved dramatically in recent years. 
#### Observations: 
A cursory examination of the datasets reveal certain trends such as players within certain age groups exhibiting distinct patterns in their performance metrics. For example, younger players may show higher scores in metrics related to physical athleticism, such as points per game, rebounds, or steals. In contrast, older players might demonstrate superiority in strategic aspects of the game, like assists-to-turnover ratio or three-point shooting accuracy. We also may witness that projections to real life performance may vary quite a bit between generations of players. Older players might be expected to regress significantly while on the other hand younger players might be expected to improve.
