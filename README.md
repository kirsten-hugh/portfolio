### 2023 Top 100 NBA Players Visualizations
- I completed this project my final semester of graduate school, Decemeber 2023, for a data visualization class.
- For a more in-depth explanation of the visualizations, a PowerPoint can be found in my NBA Project GitHub folder.
  
#### Objective:
This project aims to conduct a detailed analysis of the top 100 NBA players’ performance,
focusing specifically on the correlation between player demographics (e.g. age and height)
and the nine standard statistical categories for the 2023-2024 season (using pre-season
projected and current performance measures). This analysis is not only pertinent to sports
enthusiasts and analysts but also holds significant value in the domains of both sports
management and betting industries. Understanding the impact of demographics on
performance can aid in player development, team composition internally, betting strategies
for industry outsiders and plenty of other real life applicable relevant uses.

#### Chosen Datasets & Sources:
1. Main Data Set: Top 100 NBA Players Projections & Current Performance Statistics for 2023 - 2024: <a href="https://hashtagbasketball.com/fantasy-basketball-rankings"> Hashtag Basketball</a>
2. 2022-2023 NBA Player Demographics: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data"> Kaggle</a>

#### Preliminary Analysis
#### Hypothesis: 
Age correlates with certain improvements or declines in specific statistical performance categories. For instance, older players might show a pattern of underperforming in some projected performance categories for the season. However, the negative impact of old age is overestimated in projections as modern medicine and longevity-focused practices have improved dramatically in recent years. 
#### Observations: 
A cursory examination of the datasets reveal certain trends such as players within certain age groups exhibiting distinct patterns in their performance metrics. For example, younger players may show higher scores in metrics related to physical athleticism, such as points per game, rebounds, or steals. In contrast, older players might demonstrate superiority in strategic aspects of the game, like assists-to-turnover ratio or three-point shooting accuracy. We also may witness that projections to real life performance may vary quite a bit between generations of players. Older players might be expected to regress significantly while on the other hand younger players might be expected to improve.

#### Below are a couple of the visualizations I created for this project ----
#### Performance:
<img src="images/NBA_Performance.png"/>

- Points Over Projection vs Age is visualization that shows how much are players are overperforming/underperforming compared to what experts thought they would do this season. Here the players who are majorly overperforming their projections are younger players.
- The gradient of orange is each player’s Field Goal Percentage (measure of efficiency; how many times players are scoring points (excluding free throws) out of 100). The darker shade of orange indicating that those players are more efficient.
- A red line was added at 0 to delineate and emphasize the baseline whether players were either over the line, thus overperforming or underperforming, marked below the line.

#### Points Scored by State:
<img src="images/NBA_Points_State.png"/>

- A majority of the top 100 players are from the US - 76/100 players. California has the most amount of points scored: 207.1 points and 12 players from here. This is followed by Texas with 7 players scoring 135.1 points. Finally, with the third largest amount of points is Georgia with 5 players scoring 90.5 points of this season. 
- A stepped color key was chosen instead of a gradient for these maps to make cutoffs of points scored less ambiguous.
